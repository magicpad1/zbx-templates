Modified template for Vipnet HW Coordinator Zabbix SNMP Monitoring.

Unfortunatly, didn't have the origin link.

Tested on Vipnet HW1000 Q8.

Created on Zabbix 6.4.

1. Enable + config SNMP on Vipnet Coordinator
2. Map template to host + run autodiscovery
3. It will be better to disable all elements for interfaces in down operation state
